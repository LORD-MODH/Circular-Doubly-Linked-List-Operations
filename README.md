# Circular Doubly-Linked List in C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Circular Doubly-Linked List. The list supports basic operations such as adding nodes, inserting nodes at the beginning, inserting nodes at the end, and inserting nodes at a specific position.

## Features

- Struct `node` represents each node in the list, containing an integer `data` and pointers to the next and previous nodes.
- `createnode(int data)` function to create a new node with the given data.
- `add(int data)` function to add a new node to the list.
- `at_beginning(int data)` function to insert a new node at the beginning of the list.
- `at_end(int data)` function to insert a new node at the end of the list.
- `insert(int data, int pos)` function to insert a new node at a specified position in the list.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the main.cpp file.
